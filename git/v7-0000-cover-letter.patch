Subject: [PATCH v7 0/6] Move PGP verification out of verify-tag

This is a follow up of [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. patches 1/6, 2/6, are the
same as the corresponding commits in pu.

v7: 
Mostly style/clarity changes mostly. Thanks Peff, Eric and Junio for the
feedback! In summary: 

 * Eric pointed out issues with 3/6's commit message. It doesn't match the one 
   in pu though. I also took the opportunity to update payload_size to a size_t
   as Peff suggested.
 * 4/6 I updated report_name to name_to_report, I updated the commit message 
   and addressed some nits in the code, one of the fixes removed all three nits
   that Eric pointed out. I updated 5/6 to match these changes
 * I gave the commit message on 6/6 another go.

v6: 
 * As Junio suggested, updated 4/6, to include the name argument and the
   ternary operator to provide more descriptive error messages. I propagated
   these changes to 5/6 and 6/6 as well. I'm unsure about the 80-column
   on 4/6, the ternary operator is rather long.
 * Updated and reviewed the commit messages based on Eric and Junio's
   feedback

v5:
Added helpful feedback by Eric

 * Reordering of the patches, to avoid temporal inclusion of a regression
 * Fix typos here and there.
 * Review commit messages, as some weren't representative of what the patches
   were doing anymore.
 * Updated t7030 to include Peff's suggestion, and added a helped-by line here
   as it was mostly Peff's code.
 * Updated the error-handling/printing issues that were introduced when.
   libifying the verify_tag function.

v4:

Thanks Eric, Jeff, and Hannes for the feedback.

 * I relocated the sigchain_push call so it comes after the error on
   gpg-interface (thanks Hannnes for catching this).
 * I updated the unit test to match the discussion on [3]. Now it generates
   the expected output of the tag on the fly for comparison. (This is just
   copy and paste from [3], but I verified that it works by breaking the
   while)
 * I split moving the code and renaming the variables into two patches so
   these are easier to review.
 * I used an adapter on builtin/tag.c instead of redefining all the fn*
   declarations everywhere. This introduces an issue with the way git tag -v
   resolves refnames though. I added a new commit to restore the previous
   behavior of git-tag. I'm not sure if I should've split this into two commits
   though.

v3:
Thanks Eric, Jeff, for the feedback.

 * I separated the patch in multiple sub-patches.
 * I compared the behavior of previous git tag -v and git verify-tag 
   invocations to make sure the behavior is the same
 * I dropped the multi-line comment, as suggested.
 * I fixed the issue with the missing brackets in the while (this is 
   now detected by the test).

v2:

 * I moved the pgp-verification code to tag.c 
 * I added extra arguments so git tag -v and git verify-tag both work
   with the same function
 * Relocated the SIGPIPE handling code in verify-tag to gpg-interface

v1:
 
The verify tag function is just a thin wrapper around the verify-tag
command. We can avoid one fork call by doing the verification inside
the tag builtin instead.


This applies on v2.8.0. 
Thanks!
