Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/6]  Add --format to tag verification

Hello everyone,

This is a followup on [1]. There we discussed what would be the best way
to provide automated scripts with mechanisms to inspect the contents of
a tag upon verification.

We struggled a little bit with how to make this fit the current git
codebase in the best way. Specifically, we are not sure if adding the
GPG_QUIET flags and/or exposing the primitives to allocate individual
git_ref_item's would be the best way forward.

This applies on the current HEAD as well as v 2.9.10.

Thanks!
-Santiago.

P.S. Gmane seems to be broken for git after it was rebooted. Should we ping
them about it?
