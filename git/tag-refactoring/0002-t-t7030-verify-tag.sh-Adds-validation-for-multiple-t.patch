Subject: [PATCH 2/3] t/t7030-verify-tag.sh: Adds validation for multiple tags

The verify-tag command supports mutliple tag names as an argument.
However, no previous tests try to verify multiple tags at once. This
test runs the verify-tag command against three trusted tags (created
previously), and ensures that:

	1) Three tags are verified appropriately (grep GOODSIG) and
	2) The three tags verified are indeed differently (uniq
		-u)
